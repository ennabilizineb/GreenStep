## 1. Executive Summary
GreenStep is a decoupled, full-stack web application designed to help users track, analyze, and minimize their personal carbon footprints. The platform combines daily activity logging with interactive community challenges, automated eco-tips, and a dynamic gamification engine that rewards sustainable habits. 

This repository serves as the final consolidated submission, containing both the **Vue 3 Frontend Client** and the **PHP Slim 4 Backend API**.

---

## 2. Core Features
* **Real-Time Carbon Tracking:** Users can log daily activities (e.g., transportation, meals, energy usage) and see their carbon footprint calculated instantly based on dynamic emission factors.
* **Community Challenges:** Users can join global eco-challenges with collective baseline-vs-during progress tracking.
* **Gamification & Badges:** An automated streak and badge evaluation engine that rewards users for consistent eco-friendly behavior.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Visual representation of user statistics, emission trends, and earned achievements.
* **Administrative Control:** System admins can curate a daily eco-tip library and update global CO2 emission factors without touching the codebase.

---

## 3. Technology Stack
**Frontend (Client)**
* **Framework:** Vue 3 (Composition API)
* **Build Tool:** Vite
* **Routing & State:** Vue Router, Pinia/Vuex
* **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)

**Backend (REST API)**
* **Framework:** Slim 4 (PHP Micro-framework)
* **Language:** PHP 8.1+
* **Authentication:** JSON Web Tokens (JWT - `firebase/php-jwt`)
* **Architecture:** MVC Pattern (Controllers, Middleware, Support Services)

**Database**
* **Engine:** MySQL 8.0 (Relational Database)
* **Interface:** PHP Data Objects (PDO) natively parameterized.

## 4. System Architecture & Structure

GreenStep is built as a modern, decoupled full-stack application following an **MVC-inspired architectural pattern**. The design enforces a strict separation of concerns, where the Vue 3 Frontend acts entirely as a presentation and client-side state layer, and the PHP Slim 4 Backend serves purely as a headless, stateless RESTful API wrapper.

### 🗄️ Full Project Directory Blueprint

The repository is structured to cleanly isolate the backend routing, middleware, and database layers from the frontend reactive SPA components:

## 5. Database & Gamification Engine

The data layer is fully normalized to preserve relational integrity across users, core activities, and challenges. 

### Master vs. Transactional Data Split
* **Master Lookup Tables:** Tables like `Badge`, `Challenge`, and `Emission_Factors` are populated immediately upon deployment via `seed.sql`.
* **Transactional Tables:** Tables tracking user state (`activity_log`, `challenge_member`, `user_badge`) remain unseeded and clean by design, awaiting real-time population by live users.

### Dynamic Achievement Logic (Hybrid JSON Strategy)
To avoid database bloat and rigid schema migrations when adding new features, the `Badge` table leverages a **hybrid SQL-and-JSON approach**. 
Badge award thresholds (e.g., maintaining a 7-day streak) are stored directly inside a **`criteria_json`** column. The Slim backend dynamically decodes these rules during user logging, granting the development team massive flexibility to create new gamification rules without altering physical database tables.

---

## 6. Security & Threat Mitigation

The platform implements a robust defense-in-depth model:
* **SQL Injection (SQLi) Prevention:** Direct SQL concatenation is strictly forbidden. The database connection factory explicitly **disables emulated prepared statements** in PDO. All transactional queries compile natively on the MySQL server, isolating user inputs strictly as data parameters.
* **Stateless Authentication:** Session hijacking is prevented by using stateless JSON Web Tokens (JWT) signed via the `HS256` algorithm. 
* **Cryptographic Credential Hashing:** Passwords never enter the database in plaintext. Client credentials undergo forward-compatible hashing via PHP’s native Bcrypt implementation (`password_hash()`) and are validated using time-safe `password_verify()` utilities to prevent timing attacks.
* **Exception Shielding:** A custom `JsonErrorHandler` ensures that stack traces or HTML errors are never leaked to the client in production, returning secure JSON error envelopes instead.

## 7. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Access levels are managed at the routing layer via a custom `JwtAuthMiddleware` firewall:

| Role Level | Access Permissions |
| :--------- | :----------------- |
| **Public** | Login (`/api/auth/login`) & Registration (`/api/auth/register`). |
| **Standard User** | Can log activities, view dashboards, fetch daily tips, and join community challenges. |
| **Community Leader** | Inherits User permissions + Create, Update, or Delete community challenges. |
| **System Admin** | Inherits all permissions + Manage global Eco-Tip library and alter systemic Emission Factors. |
